# Current State

- Goal: Continue from the implemented Windows cleanup MVP with TOML-backed browser/system/development cache rules, bounded glob/profile discovery, and usable rule selection UX.
- Branch: feat/windows-cleanup-mvp
- Last verified: `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo check --workspace`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`, and `cargo nextest run --workspace` all passed on 2026-06-23. `cargo nextest run --workspace` ran 47 tests successfully. `cargo run -q -p rebecca-cli -- scan --category browser` listed the 3 browser rules grouped under `browser`; a JSON dry-run smoke over `windows.chrome-cache` and `windows.edge-cache` produced 12 targets, 3 allowed, 9 skipped, and no blocked or failed targets on the current machine.
- Done: Initialized `docs/knowledge/engineering`; collected Mole, windows-cleaner-cli, CrunchyCleaner, BleachBit, and Bulk Crap Uninstaller references; created platform, architecture, workspace, privilege, registry, scan-engine, deletion/recovery, rule-provenance, and local-state ADRs; initialized the `rebecca` Cargo workspace and crates; created the Windows cleanup MVP implementation plan; implemented the MVP cleanup loop across core, rules, Windows adapter, CLI, history, and tests; changed Windows Recycle Bin execution to preserve directory targets and move their direct child entries; added planner and CLI regression tests for overlapping templates; externalized the built-in rules into TOML files under `crates/rebecca-rules/rules/windows/` with schema and provenance validation; added rule authoring guidance and expanded the built-in catalog to Chrome, DirectX shader cache, pip, VS Code, and Windows Error Reporting; added `glob-template` rule targets with bounded wildcard discovery; added Firefox profile cache and Windows thumbnail/icon cache rules; added reusable `RuleSelection` semantics and `scan --category/--rule` filtering with grouped human output; expanded Chrome and Edge cache rules to cover explicit `Default` targets plus bounded `Profile *` Cache, Code Cache, and GPUCache targets.
- In progress: No active implementation task.
- Blocked: None.
- Next action: Start a progress/output pass for larger scans before expanding heavier catalogs, or add another small owned catalog batch such as Discord/Steam/JetBrains caches.
