# Current State

- Goal: Continue from the implemented Windows cleanup MVP with an externalized and expanded built-in rule catalog.
- Branch: feat/windows-cleanup-mvp
- Last verified: `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo check --workspace`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`, and `cargo nextest run --workspace` all passed on 2026-06-23. `cargo nextest run --workspace` ran 38 tests successfully. `cargo run -p rebecca-cli -- scan` listed 8 built-in rules from the TOML-backed catalog. A dry-run smoke over the five new rules completed with 6 allowed targets, 5 skipped missing paths, and no blocked or failed targets.
- Done: Initialized `docs/knowledge/engineering`; collected Mole, windows-cleaner-cli, CrunchyCleaner, BleachBit, and Bulk Crap Uninstaller references; created platform, architecture, workspace, privilege, registry, scan-engine, deletion/recovery, rule-provenance, and local-state ADRs; initialized the `rebecca` Cargo workspace and crates; created the Windows cleanup MVP implementation plan; implemented the MVP cleanup loop across core, rules, Windows adapter, CLI, history, and tests; changed Windows Recycle Bin execution to preserve directory targets and move their direct child entries; added planner and CLI regression tests for overlapping templates; externalized the built-in rules into TOML files under `crates/rebecca-rules/rules/windows/` with schema and provenance validation; added rule authoring guidance and expanded the built-in catalog to Chrome, DirectX shader cache, pip, VS Code, and Windows Error Reporting.
- In progress: No active implementation task.
- Blocked: None.
- Next action: Add profile/glob discovery support before adding rules that need multi-profile traversal, such as Firefox profiles and thumbnail cache files.
