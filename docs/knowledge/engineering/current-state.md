# Current State

- Goal: Continue from the implemented Windows cleanup MVP with TOML-backed browser/system/development cache rules, bounded glob/profile discovery, usable rule selection UX, readable dry-run output, target-level scan progress, and a growing owned catalog.
- Branch: feat/windows-cleanup-mvp
- Last verified: `cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo nextest run -p rebecca-rules`, `cargo nextest run -p rebecca-core --test planner`, and `cargo nextest run -p rebecca-cli --test cli_scan` all passed on 2026-06-23.
- Done: Initialized `docs/knowledge/engineering`; collected Mole, windows-cleaner-cli, CrunchyCleaner, BleachBit, and Bulk Crap Uninstaller references; created platform, architecture, workspace, privilege, registry, scan-engine, deletion/recovery, rule-provenance, and local-state ADRs; initialized the `rebecca` Cargo workspace and crates; created the Windows cleanup MVP implementation plan; implemented the MVP cleanup loop across core, rules, Windows adapter, CLI, history, and tests; changed Windows Recycle Bin execution to preserve directory targets and move their direct child entries; added planner and CLI regression tests for overlapping templates; externalized the built-in rules into TOML files under `crates/rebecca-rules/rules/windows/` with schema and provenance validation; added rule authoring guidance and expanded the built-in catalog to Chrome, DirectX shader cache, pip, VS Code, and Windows Error Reporting; added `glob-template` rule targets with bounded wildcard discovery; added Firefox profile cache and Windows thumbnail/icon cache rules; added reusable `RuleSelection` semantics and `scan --category/--rule` filtering with grouped human output; expanded Chrome and Edge cache rules to cover explicit `Default` targets plus bounded `Profile *` Cache, Code Cache, and GPUCache targets; improved human cleanup plan output with human-readable byte sizes, largest estimated targets, and status-grouped target details; added target-level planner progress events, `indicatif` CLI progress reporting, and `clean --no-progress`; added JetBrains IDE cache coverage under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\JetBrains\\<product><version>\\caches`; added Cargo dependency cache coverage for `%CARGO_HOME%` and default `%USERPROFILE%\\.cargo` cache subdirectories.
- In progress: No active implementation task.
- Blocked: None.
- Next action: Consider file-level walker progress if target-level progress is not enough for very large directories, or add another small owned catalog batch such as Discord/Steam caches.
